    content: |-
      I specialize in detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves in ground-based detectors. I am particularly interested in developing novel techniques for analyzing data from current and next-generation observatories, including LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and future detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.
      I am also involed in science outreach. As a member of CoffeeShop Astrophysics, I have given various public talks.
