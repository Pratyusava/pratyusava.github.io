    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am a PhD candidate in Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, working on detecting and measuring gravitational waves in current and future observatories. My research focuses on parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals, localization studies for next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer, and developing machine learning tools for gravitational wave astronomy.

      As a member of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, I have contributed to several major publications and developed novel techniques for analyzing gravitational wave data. My work spans both theoretical aspects of general relativity and practical data analysis challenges in multi-messenger astronomy.
